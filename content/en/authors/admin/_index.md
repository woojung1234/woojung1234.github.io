I'm Woojung Kim, majoring in statistics and computer engineering at Chonbuk National University. My goal is to become good at web development. I want to try making game statistics sites and making shopping malls. I'm still not familiar with web development languages because I just got interested. I'm aiming to get used to web development this semester. Thank you for visiting.
